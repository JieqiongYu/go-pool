# Gulp

Gulp is a tool for creating workflows. A workflow is a step-by-step process. It is nothing but a task streamlining application. You need NPM and Node installled on your machine. We use Gulp to watch the files and then update the binary and restart the API server. 

## Install Gulp and Gulp-shell

```bash
npm install gulp gulp-shell
```

## Create gulpfile.js

Create a `gulpfile.js` in the root directory of the project. Here, it is `github.com/src/restful-web-services/roman-numeral/romanserver`.
